# Markdown Style Guide

This document explains our markdown linting configuration and rules. We use a relatively lenient configuration to prioritize content over strict formatting.

## Configuration File

Our `.markdownlint.json` configuration is designed to be practical and not overly restrictive. Here's what each rule means:

### Line Length (MD013)

- Maximum line length is set to 200 characters
- No length restrictions for:
  - Code blocks
  - Tables
  - Headings

### Disabled Rules

We've disabled several rules to make documentation more practical:

| Rule  | Description                 | Why Disabled                               |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MD009 | Trailing spaces             | Sometimes needed for line breaks           |
| MD031 | Blank lines around code     | Not always necessary for readability       |
| MD032 | Blank lines around lists    | Flexible list formatting                   |
| MD034 | Bare URLs                   | URLs can be more readable without brackets |
| MD040 | Code block language         | Optional syntax highlighting               |
| MD041 | First line h1               | Flexible document structure                |
| MD047 | End file with newline       | Not critical for content                   |
| MD022 | Blank lines around headings | Flexible heading formatting                |
| MD024 | Duplicate headings          | Allow similar section names                |
| MD033 | Inline HTML                 | Sometimes needed for advanced formatting   |
| MD012 | Multiple blank lines        | Allow visual separation                    |
| MD036 | Emphasis in headings        | Allow emphasized headings                  |

## Next Steps

Now that we have our markdown linting configured, here are the next steps for the project:

1. **Documentation Updates**

   - Review and update existing documentation
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Create contribution guidelines

2. **Testing**

   - Add more unit tests
   - Set up integration tests
   - Configure test coverage reporting

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**

   - Set up automated builds
   - Configure deployment workflows
   - Add quality checks

4. **Features**
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add user authentication
   - Create admin dashboard
