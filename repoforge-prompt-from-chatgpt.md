## 🏆 Learning by Doing: How It Works
When a developer forks this repo, they can complete structured tasks inside `TASKS.md` to simulate a real-world contribution workflow:

### **🔹 1. Issue Management**
- **Task:** Open a new issue using the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
- **Goal:** Learn how to write a clear, actionable issue.

### **🔹 2. Pull Request Best Practices**
- **Task:** Create a feature branch and submit a PR using the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- **Goal:** Learn proper branch naming, commit messages, and PR descriptions.

### **🔹 3. Automated CI/CD Checks**
- **Task:** Push code and trigger GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `lint.yml`).
- **Goal:** Understand how automation ensures code quality.

### **🔹 4. Documentation & Code Standards**
- **Task:** Add a new entry in `README.md` and follow the Markdown style guide.
- **Goal:** Learn documentation best practices.

## 🛠 GitHub Project Board: Kanban Workflow
PerfectRepo includes a **GitHub Project Board** to manage tasks efficiently, similar to VS Code’s repository structure. The board has the following columns:

- **📌 To Do** – Issues waiting to be worked on
- **🚀 In Progress** – Ongoing PRs
- **✅ Done** – Merged PRs, completed tasks

### **How to Use It?**
1️⃣ Open an issue and add it to the **To Do** column.  
2️⃣ When working on an issue, move it to **In Progress**.  
3️⃣ Once reviewed and merged, move it to **Done**.  

## 📈 Roadmap & Backlog
### **ROADMAP.md** – Defines milestones and future plans.
Example:
```md
